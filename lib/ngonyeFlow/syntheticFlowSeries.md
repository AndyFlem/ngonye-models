# Ngonye Falls Synthetic Historic Flow Series

To produce a long time series (1924 to date) of daily flow for the Ngonye Falls site, a correlation is carried out between the overlapping portions of the *Zambezi River Authority* (ZRA) gauge at Ngonye Falls (the "Sioma Gauge") and the record of the Victoria Falls gauges (2005- to date).

Once correlated, the full Victoria Falls gauge record is extrapolated to produce a synthetic record for Ngonye Falls.

The procedure was initially completed by Mott MacDonald for the project feasibility study for the overlapping period 2005/06 - 2016/17.

This model allows the procedure to be extended with available data up to date.

Note: *Water Year* is defined as running from 1st Oct to end Sept as is usual in the region.

## Procedure

From: **Mott MacDonald** - *Ngonye Falls Hydropower Project - 2018 Feasibility Study Update - Final Report Version D*

1. Calculate Flow Duration Curves (FDCs) from daily data for the following:
    1. The target site (Ngonye) for 2005/06 – 2016/17; 
    2. The analogue site (Victoria Falls) for the exact period of data at the target site (2005/06 – 2016/17);
    3. Analogue site for long-term record (1924/25 -2016/17); 
    
    
2. Compare the FDCs for the analogue site for the two periods and derive factors between the shorter and longer periods; 

3. Apply these factors to the target site FDC to produce an estimated long-term FDC for the target site;

4. For each daily flow value at the analogue site, determine its position on the long-term FDC (percentile); and,

5. Look up the flow value for this percentile from the estimated long-term FDC for the target site taking into account of the 11-day time lag.
